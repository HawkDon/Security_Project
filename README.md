## Healthy security for a regular project

Our project is supposed to show a good way to handle and execute different tasks in a standard:

`Database <-> Backend -> * JSON REQUESTS * <-  Frontend` relationship.

We will use the current points, build on another idea of a subject for a website:

* **SQL injection preventions**
* **Hashing of passwords**
* **Crypto ciphering of user details**
* **Stronger security for register credentials in form of identity keys**
* **Cookie authorization**
* **CORS**
